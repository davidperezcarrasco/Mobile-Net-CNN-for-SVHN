# Mobile-Net-CNN-for-SVHN with 94% of accuracy
Implemented a MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve 94% accuracy on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The focus is on minimizing the number of parameters in the model for efficient deployment on mobile and resource-constrained devices.
